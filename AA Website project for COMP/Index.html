<p> press this button for a secret method ↑ </p>
<p> I just have rick-roll people and I need to ensure that you never lend anyone the tips that I show you on this website. </p>
<h2> What the rickroll is</h2>
<style> body { background-color:rgb(79, 141, 206); } </style>
<p> The rickroll is a song, called never gonna give you up, by rick astley and it is used by discord mods all around the world. Most people who use the rickroll are insanely smart and they are super good looking</p>
<p> All I ask in return is that you allow one new person into your discord server and rickroll them like it is all you know. </p>
<h2> <b> My number 1 method</b> </h2>
<p> <mark> Most would think that the most efficient way is a link to the youtube video, and sometimes that is too easy. <br> If you would like the link it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ and make sure you can spot it so you don't get rickrolled</mark> <br> My way of ensuring that people don't catch me is by giving them an image or a video.</p>
<p> What I like to do is to create an Imovie that starts with a picture of you, use photo booth for this picture as it works best with Imovie
and after you have that you will want to get a recording of the song, "Never Gonna Give You Up" and put it after your photo. <br> The way to use this is through <mark> Quick Time player</mark>
and when you get that screen recording export the video and rename it or my favorite method, create another screen recording of the Imovie. </p>
<p> Here's a quick list of other methods.</p>
<ul> <li> Discord GIF</li> <li> Photo Booth Video</li> <li> Rick Roll Websites</li></ul>

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> It is crucial that you don't send these websites to a group chat, because if only one person is online than it is a website wasted, use the websites when multiple people are looking for something and they have a problem, then multiple people click on the link</p> 
<div style="color:red" style="text-align: center;"> <h2 style=font-size:20px;> Why to use a rick-roll</h2> <p style="font-size:15px"> The main purpose of a rick roll is to do what is called a troll, and it is a funny and easy way to prank your friends, and sometimes people take it too seriously, like you, since you came to this website. Choose to go to another hobby, one not so defined by trolling people and being a sweaty discord mod</p>  </div>
